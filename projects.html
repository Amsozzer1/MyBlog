        <h3>Project 1: Weather Application (Java)</h3>
        <p>Description: The program uses the JSON.simple library to parse the JSON response from the WeatherAPI and create a GUI window. The program first prompts the user to enter a city name, and then uses the Weather API to get the weather information for the entered city. The program then parses a CSV file containing weather condition codes and their corresponding icons, and displays the appropriate icon for the weather condition. The program also displays other relevant weather information such as the city name, country, date and time, temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>

        <h3>Project 2: Password vault</h3>
        <p>Description: Password Vault Application This Java project is a simple password vault application that allows users to store and retrieve passwords for various applications. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing to interact with the user.

          Features Add a new password: Users can add a new password entry to the vault by providing the application name, username, and password. Retrieve an old password: Users can retrieve previously saved passwords from the vault and view them in a table format. Password protection: The vault is password-protected, and users need to provide the correct password to access its functionalities. Prerequisites Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Any Java IDE or a command-line interface to compile and run the application. Getting Started Clone the project repository or download the source code files. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. Compile and run the App class to start the password vault application. The application will prompt for the password to access the vault. Enter the correct password ("AHMED" in this case). Once inside the vault, choose one of the following options: To add a new password, enter 1 and fill in the required details in the GUI form. To retrieve old passwords, enter 2, and a table will be displayed with previously saved passwords. To quit the application, enter 3. Upon exiting the application, any new passwords added will be saved to a file named help.csv. Note: Make sure to have the required permissions to read and write files in the project directory.

        <h3>Project 3: Employee Data Entry App</h3>
        <p>Description: Employee Data Entry App
          This is a Java application that allows you to manage employee data using a graphical user interface (GUI). It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing employee records.

          Technologies Used
          Java
          MySQL
          Features
          Insert Employee Data
          In the "Insert" tab of the application, you can enter details of a new employee such as last name, first name, address, city, state, date of birth, and salary. Clicking the "Save Employee" button will save the entered data into the MySQL database.

          Update Employee Data
          In the "Update Employee" tab, you can search for an employee by their ID and retrieve their existing data from the database. The retrieved data will be displayed in the corresponding fields. You can then modify any field and click the "Update Employee" button to save the changes back to the database.

          Delete Employee Data
          In the "Update Employee" tab, you can also delete an employee from the database by entering their ID and clicking the "Delete Employee" button. A confirmation dialog will be displayed before deleting the employee.

          Clear Employee Data
          Both in the "Insert" and "Update Employee" tabs, you can clear all the input fields by clicking the "Clear Employee" or "Clear" button, respectively.

          Usage
          Make sure you have Java and MySQL installed on your system.
          Set up a MySQL database with the necessary tables for employee data storage.
          Configure the database connection settings in the application.
          Compile and run the EmployeeGUI.java file.
          Dependencies
          This application uses the following dependencies:

          Java Swing
          MySQL Connector/J
          Make sure to include the required JAR files in the classpath when compiling and running the application.


          Note
          This application is a simple implementation and does not include advanced error handling or security features. Use it for educational or prototyping purposes and enhance it as needed for production use.
